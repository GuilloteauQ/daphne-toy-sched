- Packaged daphne in Nix for better reproducibility: https://github.com/GuilloteauQ/daphne-nix
- to avoid rebuild everything all the time, i also set up a binary cache at https://daphne-nix.cachix.org
- the packaging is a bit dirty still, but good enough for simple tests
  - some of the deps are not managed (like cuda, mpi, fpga stuff)

Starting to look at the delivrable D5.2

- csv files are big, let's put them on zenodo
  - https://zenodo.org/record/8208151
- let's also start some snakemake boilerplate to automatize all of this
- let's also change the daphne script
  - we increase the `maxi` variable which seems to represent the number of iterations of the algorithm
  - we also add an argument to have several iterations
