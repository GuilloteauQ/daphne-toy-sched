- Packaged daphne in Nix for better reproducibility: https://github.com/GuilloteauQ/daphne-nix
- to avoid rebuild everything all the time, i also set up a binary cache at https://daphne-nix.cachix.org
- the packaging is a bit dirty still, but good enough for simple tests
  - some of the deps are not managed (like cuda, mpi, fpga stuff)

Starting to look at the delivrable D5.2
